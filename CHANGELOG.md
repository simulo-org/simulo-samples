# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Releases are
tagged by calendar version, `vYYYY.MM.N`, because this repository publishes samples rather
than an interface: there is no API here whose compatibility a semantic version could describe.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold and structural checks for the sample catalog.
- Hello: submit a job, follow its log, and read its result. Requests no GPU.
- Cartpole: train a balancing policy and read the reward trend and saved checkpoint.
- Cartpole Eval: train, score over several rounds, then play the policy back and record it.
- Samples declare compatibility with Simulo client versions `>=0.23.1,<0.25`.
